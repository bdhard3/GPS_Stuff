GPS_Stuff (8/19/2013)
=========
This repository will be used for my current GPS project containing 3 items.
1.) Executable C++ program which will read in GPS data from a file formatted to my own special protocol.
2.) File(s) containing GPS data in the form of ".txt"
3.) A batch file, which when run, prompts the user for a certain response and then outputs 
    a ".kml" file according the current specification.
    -Note: only date and custom file name are currently implemented. Future releases of the program will allow the user
    to customize the color of the path, and also setting placemarks on the map.
